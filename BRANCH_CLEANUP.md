## Next Steps:

Your `main` branch is ready for deployment:

- Trigger "Manual Deploy"
- Set environment variables

### 2. Optional: Clean Up Other Branches

If you want to clean up the old Copilot branches on GitHub:

```bash
# Delete remote branches (one at a time or all)
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-duplicate-column-error
git push origin --delete copilot/squash-all-migrations-into-baseline
git push origin --delete copilot/update-migration-check-assessment-question-id
git push origin --delete copilot/update-migration-checks-for-existence
git push origin --delete copilot/update-migration-checks-for-tables
git push origin --delete revert-3-copilot/update-migration-checks-for-tables
```

### 3. Optional: Delete Local Backup

If you don't need the backup from October 8:
```bash
git branch -D backup-main-20251008
```
