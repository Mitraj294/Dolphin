// Deprecated model shim removed. The application now uses `OrganizationAssessment`.
// This file intentionally left minimal to signal that `Assessment` is deprecated.

// Note: If any code still imports or instantiates `App\Models\Assessment` you
// should update it to use `App\Models\OrganizationAssessment` instead. The
// shim was removed to avoid silently carrying legacy behavior.

// (No class defined)
